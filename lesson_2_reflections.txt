What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    A hidden .git folder is created in the directory, and this is necesary 
    because thatÂ´s the way git knows it will start managing the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area is an intermediate zone that allows to undo temporary 
    changes.
