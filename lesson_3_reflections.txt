When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?

    When you want someone else could help you remotely. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because you can select only the changes that you approve that other people
    have made.
