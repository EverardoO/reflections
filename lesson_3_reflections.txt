When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?

    When you want someone else could help you remotely. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because you can select only the changes that you approve that other people
    have made. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you 
use one instead of another?

    A fork is used when you want to copy a repository from a GitHub account to 
    another, we use clon when we want to copy a local repository to another 
    directory or a GitHub one to a local repository, and we use branch when we
    want to work on another place some functions without modify our master 
    branch.
